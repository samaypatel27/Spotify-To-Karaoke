# About
This website is a personal project of mine. The user, first, logs into Spotify using Spotify OAuth, and is then redirected to a dashboard page where they can view all of their spotify playlists and songs. 
From there, the user can select specific songs, and convert their playlist into a YouTube one with Karaoke, by logging in with YouTube right after. As of now, this website isn't hosted on a public domain, but I
do plan to in the future.

# Stacks
