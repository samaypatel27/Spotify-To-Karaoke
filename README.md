# About
Full-stack React-app, using Spotify & YouTube APIs/OAuth 2.0 to develop a platform to convert spotify playlists into karaoke equivalents on YouTube

# Stacks
OLD CLIENT:
Front-End: React.js, CSS, Bootstrap <br>
Back-End: Python (Flask), SQLite

# Instructions
1. This project uses Flask for the backend. Python packages will need to be installed on a virtual environment created in the **Server** folder
   Install dependencies after creating and activating your virtual environment: ```pip install Flask Flask-Cors requests spotipy google-auth google-auth-oauthlib```
2. Download the _client_secret.json_ file and place it in the Server folder. This file contains information for the YouTube Data API and is accessed in the backend
3. For development purposes, SQLite is used for storage. Download the **DB Browser for SQLite** app from the internet, or from the official website. Then, create a database file by selecting "create database" in the app and placing it in the Server folder
